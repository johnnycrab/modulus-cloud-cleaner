modulus-cloud-cleaner
=====================

Either I am stupid or there is no "easy-click-a-button" way to clean the CLOUD_DIR of your modulus.io project. However sometimes – for example when refreshing a project – you want to delete all files. Especially when you have to pay for every gigabyte you use.

This simple script helps to delete all files. Simply deploy it to your modulus.io - project, navigate to it, and it will list all files within the CLOUD_DIR. Click on "Clean it up" and everything will be as fresh as spring or whatever.
